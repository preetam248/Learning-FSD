    <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe</h1>
 

    Ingredients
  
      1 cup unsalted butter, melted
    1 cup white sugar
      1 cup packed brown sugar
      2 teaspoons vanilla extract
      2 large eggs
      3 cups all-purpose flour
      1 teaspoon baking soda
      1/2 teaspoon baking powder
      1/2 teaspoon salt
      2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>


    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    
      Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
     
        In a large bowl, mix together the melted butter, white sugar, and brown
        sugar until well blended.
     
      Beat in the vanilla extract and eggs until light and creamy.
    
        Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate
        bowl. Gradually stir into the butter and sugar mixture.

      Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon.
   
        Drop cookie dough by rounded spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
    
  
        Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are
        lightly browned.
   
    
        Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire
        racks to cool completely.
    
 

    <h2>Notes</h2>
 
      For softer cookies, reduce baking time slightly. For crispier cookies,
      increase baking time slightly. Enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies
      with a glass of milk!
